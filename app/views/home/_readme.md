# TL;DR

- TokenHub lets you store and distribute design tokens
- a design token is a tiny individual value that describes a design
- for example, a particular color or a font size can be a token
- first, create a space
- then, create lists of tokens inside that space
- access the tokens through an API, or a static CSS file
- you’ll get it once you play around with the provided example inside the space

## Token-whaa?

Welcome. I hope you’re having a nice day.

I’ve been a designer for a while. But last year I gave this intense programming school a try. It took about a year of hard, and honestly sort of boring work (ha ha).

This school was an awesome experience, and I learned a ton. But now that it’s over, I don’t really have much to show for it in terms of published projects or anything. The goal of the school was to master the fundamentals of programming, not to build a portfolio.

So I needed a project to apply all of the stuff I learned, learn more stuff, and gain experience building something real.

This is that real thing I built. It’s a little *out there*, so bear with me. I will try to explain.

## Project requirements

These requirements helped me narrow down project ideas:

- teaches me how to build & deploy a web app
- is visual, interactive, easy to understand
- has wow factor
- lets me experience delivering a project with fixed constraints
- can be showcased to increase my credibility as a software engineer
- can be shipped in 5 weeks
- combines aspects of software engineering and product design
- is interesting to me personally

## The 4 stages in the life of a token

a) authoring (coming up with tokens) — TokenHub Templates / duplicating lists
b) managing (organizing tokens) — TokenHub
c) distributing (delivering tokens to clients) — API / static CSS
d) consuming (applying the tokens to build an interface) — sample client apps
